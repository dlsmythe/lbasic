This is a simple BASIC interpreter, written in Common Lisp.

It implements a subset of HP Timeshared BASIC, for the HP2000,
sufficient to run the 1975 version of Oregon Trail.

I was looking for a project sufficiently complex to force me to learn
Common Lisp a step or two beyond superficiality.  I'm sure my lisp is
naiive, feel free to comment on how I might improve.
